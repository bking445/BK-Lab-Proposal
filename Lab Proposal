## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Superman Final project

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Its going to be a python game that looks like a flappy bird play style but with superman as the flappy bird character and the tubes are going to be buildings.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This program that I will be writing will be a pygame in python. I am going to have to import images into the program with the background, bulidings, and superman. My software will make a game like flappy bird but just with superman version instead. I will use functions, variables, etc. It will be excuted by pygame in pthon. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
N/A
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to make the game run with the superman flying with having the background move with it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will be able to have superman fly between the buildings and make the game stop if he hits one of the buildings and make the user restart the game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game will be able to run smoothly and the game restarting when the user fails to have superman not hit the buildings.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to create a pygame and understand how to get the keyboard to interact with the program. I will need to research flappy bird pygame. I will need to research how to make the game stop and restart when the user messes up in the game.
